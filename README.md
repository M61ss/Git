# Git fast guide

In this repository you can find a fast guide to use cli Git.

Writing these modules I assume that you have already an idea of what is Git and its purpose, but you are confused about its working and benefits.

It is also useful to learn how to use a lot of graphical interfaces because they use a very similar terminology to describe available operations with Git. An example of complete and easy to use graphical interface is GitHub Desktop.

## Verify your installation

To get sure if Git is installed, run this command:

```
git --version
```

If the output is the Git version, you have Git. Otherwise, you need to install that.
